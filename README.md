# Joan Device Log Analyzer

This application serves as a robust log parser for Joan devices. By uploading a log file (in `.txt` format), you can generate a detailed analysis that includes key device information and a comprehensive list of any detected errors. Each error is accompanied by a clear description of its meaning, along with recommended procedures for troubleshooting and device handling.

*Version 1.0 - Initial release. Further enhancements are in development.*
